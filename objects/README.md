#Objects

Although I was unable to complete this task, I was able to formulate an approach. My use of the IRB shell has been limited to basic Ruby sandbox use. What I have discoverd is IRB roots back to Kernal and it is possible to see each shells history.  All of which is stored in an object that can be parsed through.

My approach that I wanted to implement is to have an .rb generate two sub-shells with the text given. Using IRB History would then be used to parse through the object that makes up Shell 1 and copy what is missing to Shell 2 and execute.
